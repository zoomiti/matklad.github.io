<p>There’s a bit of discussion happening in Rust community on the generic associated types topic.
I can not help but add my own thoughts to the pile :-)</p>

<p>I don’t intend to write a well-edited post considering all pros and cones (intentional typo to demonstrate how unedited this is).
Rather, I just want to dump my experience as is.
Ultimately I trust the lang team to make the right call here <strong><strong>way</strong></strong> more than I trust myself.
The post could be read as a bit inflammatory, but my stated goal here is not to sway someone’s mind by the arguments, but rather expose my own thinking process.</p>

<p>This post is partially prompted by the following comment from the RFC:</p>

<figure class="blockquote">
<blockquote>
<p>I probably have GATs in every project I do write.</p>
</blockquote>

</figure>

<p>It stuck with me, because this is very much the opposite of the experience I have.
I’ve been using Rust extensively for a while, mostly as an application (as opposed to library) developer, and I can’t remember a single instance where I really wanted to have GATs.
This is a consequences of my overall code style — I try to use abstraction sparingly and rarely reach out for traits.
I don’t think I’ve ever build a meaningful abstraction which was expressed via traits?
On the contrary, I try hard to make everything concrete and non-generic on the language level.</p>

<p>What’s more, when I do reach out for traits, most of the time this is to use trait objects, which give me a new runtime capability to use different, substitutable concrete type.
For the static,monomorphization based subset of traits I find that most of the time non-trait solution seem to work.</p>

<p>And I think GATs (and associated types in general) don’t work with trait objects, which probably explains why, even when I use traits, I don’t generally need GATs.
Though, it seems to me that lifetime-only subset of GATs actually works with trait objects?
That is, lending iterator seems to be object safe?</p>

<p>I guess, the only place where I do, indirectly, want GATs is to make <code>async trait</code> work, but even then, I usually am interested in object-safe async traits, which I think don’t need and can’t use GATs?</p>
<hr />
<p>Another disconnection between my usage of Rust and discussion surrounding the GATs is in one of the prominent examples — parser combinator library.
In practice, for me parser combinator’s primary use-case was always a vehicle for teaching advanced types (eg, the monads paper uses parsers as one of the examples).
For production use-cases I’ve encountered, it was always either a hand-written parser, or a full-blown parser generator.</p>
